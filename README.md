# The Halt to the Halting Problem

This project aims to solve the halting problem using artificial intelligence to predict whether a Python function will halt or run indefinitely.

## Description

The Halting Problem is a classic and challenging problem in computer science, often deemed impossible to solve. This project leverages artificial intelligence to predict whether a given Python function will halt or run indefinitely, aiming to make progress in addressing this problem.

## Abstract

The Halting Problem, proved unsolvable by Alan Turing in 1936, shows that it is impossible to know with certainty whether a function will halt. The problem stands as a fundamental limitation in the abilities of computers. This research aimed to utilize a neural network to find observable patterns in halting and non-halting functions. The network was trained on 200 sample functions with a known halting behavior and its hyperparameters were optimized. The model reached a mean accuracy of 62.0% out of 100 trials. An accuracy greater than 50% indicates that the model recognizes patterns in the functions and correctly classifies them most of the time.
